# share exif

This app is like [Share Edit](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/share-edit). But without the editing. And without most of the sharing. Really, it's nothing like it at all, except for it uses basically the same code.

This app will show you the exif data of images. If you are on Android using Chrome 76+, you can install this app with the "Add to home screen" prompt, and then select Exif from the share sheet to load an image and see the exif information.

And if you are a photography nerd like me, please check out my desktop RAW image viewer app, [Raw Viewer](https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer).
